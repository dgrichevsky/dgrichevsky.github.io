                <p> Hi there! My name is Daniel Grichevsky and I am a current sophomore studying computer science at Tufts University. This past summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at IBM within their e-commerce division developing an advertising platform for marketers to launch targeted ads via social media. After Tufts, I hope to continue working on software development, specifically financial technology while attending business school with the goal of eventually working for a venture capital firm. </p>
